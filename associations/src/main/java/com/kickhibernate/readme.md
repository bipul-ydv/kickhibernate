 **Associations**
Associations describe how two or more entities form a relationship based on a database joining semantics.

**@ManyToOne**

@ManyToOne is the most common association, having a direct equivalent in the relational database as well (e.g. foreign key), and so it establishes a relationship between a child entity and a parent.
